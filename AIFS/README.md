# Automated Integrated Farming System

## Overview
This project presents a smart integrated farming system designed to automate and optimize multiple aspects of agricultural processes. The system combines IoT-based environmental sensing, automated irrigation, aquaponics control, and livestock feeding mechanisms — creating a holistic and sustainable farming model.

## Key Features
- 🌦️ Real-time environmental monitoring (temperature, humidity, soil moisture, light)
- 🚿 Automated drip irrigation based on soil sensor thresholds
- 🐟 Aquaponics water level and nutrient flow management
- 🐔 Timed livestock feeding mechanism with servo-controlled dispenser
- 📱 Remote monitoring and control via mobile dashboard

## Hardware Stack
- Arduino Uno / Mega
- DHT11, Soil Moisture, Water Level sensors
- Solenoid valves, Relays, Servo motors
- GSM/LoRa/WiFi modules for remote communication
- Solar panel integration for off-grid power

## Software Features
- Sensor data logging and threshold-based automation
- Mobile app (Blynk/Node-RED) for user control and alerts
- Modular code for easy expansion to more crops or modules

## Impact
This system reduces labor, water waste, and resource mismanagement — especially useful for small-to-medium scale farmers looking to modernize operations with low-cost automation.
