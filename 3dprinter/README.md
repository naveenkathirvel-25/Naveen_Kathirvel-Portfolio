# CoreXY 3D Printer with Air-Pump Extrusion

## Overview
This project focuses on the design and development of a custom CoreXY-based 3D printer capable of printing high-viscosity thermoelectric materials, specifically copper selenide (Cuâ‚‚Se) nanocomposite ink. The system eliminates the need for heated beds and traditional syringe extruders by incorporating an air-pump extrusion mechanism for precision flow control.

## Key Features
- CoreXY motion system for precise X-Y movement
- Z-axis stability with lead screw and linear rails
- Custom air-pump driven syringe extruder
- MKS Gen V1.0 motherboard with Marlin firmware
- Nozzle change flexibility (0.4mm to 2mm)
- Designed to print thermoelectric legs for energy harvesting applications

## Highlights
- Improved extrusion control using air-pressure regulation
- Energy-efficient printing method for high-viscosity materials
- Validated through CAD modeling, structural simulation, and hardware testing
