# Thermal Imaging Drone for Rescue Simulation

## Overview
A multirotor drone equipped with a FLIR Lepton thermal sensor and RGB camera to perform real-time thermal mapping. The system is designed for search and rescue in low-visibility scenarios like forest fire and disaster zones.

## Features
- FLIR-based thermal imaging integration
- Onboard Jetson Nano for real-time image processing
- ROS-based thermal + RGB overlay
- Tested in mock disaster and human detection missions
